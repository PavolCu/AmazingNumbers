<p>As you know, a method can call another method. What is even more interesting, a method can call itself. This possibility is known as <strong>recursion</strong> and the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method call is the action of invoking or using a method, which is a sequence of statements, in a program. | To call a method, you use its name followed by a set of parentheses that may contain method parameters, which are values used inside the method. For example, the method calculateVolume can be called using its name and passing the necessary parameters in the parentheses. This allows you to reuse the code within the method throughout your program.">method calling</a> itself is named <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5135" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a recursive method is a method that calls itself, either directly or indirectly. | It can contain parameters and return a value, or take and return nothing. However, to avoid an infinite loop and a stack overflow error, a recursive method must have a base case that stops the recursion. When writing a recursive method, it is helpful to consider the problem as a smaller version of the same problem. For example, a method for calculating the factorial of a number can be written recursively by calling the same method with a decreased argument until it reaches the base case. It is important to note that not all recursive methods are tail-recursive, which means that nothing has to be done after the call returns.">recursive method</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As any regular method, a <strong>recursive method</strong> can contain parameters and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return is a statement that ends the execution of a method and specifies a value to be returned to the caller. | The return type of a method defines what type of value can be returned. If a method has a return type of void, it means that the method does not return any value. However, you can still use the return statement to exit the method. If a method with a void return type tries to return a value, a compile error will occur.">return</a> something, or it can take or return nothing.</p>
<p>But how many times should a method call itself? It should be limited. The method must have a special condition to stop the recursion, otherwise, the call stack will overflow and the execution will stop with an error.</p>
<p>To write <strong>recursive methods</strong> you should consider the solution of a problem as a smaller version of the same problem.</p>
<h5 id="the-factorial-example" style="text-align: center;">The factorial example</h5>
<p>The classic example of the recursion is a math function calculating <strong>the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a factorial is a mathematical operation that multiplies a number (n) by all the positive integers less than it, down to 1. | It is often used as an example of recursion, where a method calls itself within its own definition. However, the factorial method discussed here is not tail-recursive because there is additional work (multiplication of the result by a value) done after the recursive call. A tail-recursive factorial method can be written using an accumulator parameter to store the intermediate result, and returning the accumulated value when n reaches 0.">factorial</a></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">If you have forgotten or did not know, the <strong>factorial</strong> of a non-negative integer <strong>n</strong> is the product of all positive integers from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>n</strong> inclusively. E.g., the factorial of 4 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. The factorial of 0 equals 1.</div>
<p></p>
<p>Here is a recursive method which does the same using <strong>the recursive call</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static long factorial(long n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1; // the trivial case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // the recursive call
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This method has one long parameter and returns a long result. The implementation includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the trivial case that returns the value <strong>1</strong> without any recursive calls;</li>
<li>the reduction step with the recursive call to simplify the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>We suppose, the <strong>passed argument &gt;= 0</strong>. If the passed value is <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>, the result is <strong>1</strong>, otherwise, we invoke the same method decreasing the argument by one.</p>
<p>Let's invoke the method passing different arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long fact0 = factorial(0); // 1 (by definition)
long fact1 = factorial(1); // 1
long fact2 = factorial(2); // 2 (1 * 2)
long fact3 = factorial(3); // 6 (1 * 2 * 3)
long fact4 = factorial(4); // 24 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it returns the expected results.</p>
<p>But what happens if a recursive method never reaches a base case? The stack will never stop growing. If a program's stack exceeds the limit size, the <code class="language-java">StackOverflowError</code> occurs. It will crash the execution.</p>
<h5 id="replacing-recursion-by-a-loop" style="text-align: center;">Replacing recursion by a loop</h5>
<p>Every recursive method can be written iteratively using a loop.</p>
<p>Let's rewrite the factorial method in this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static long factorial(long n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}</code></pre>
<p>You can be sure that the result will be the same.</p>
<h5 id="types-of-recursions" style="text-align: center;">Types of recursions</h5>
<p>There are several types of recursions.</p>
<p><strong>1) Direct recursion.</strong> A method invokes itself like the considered factorial method.</p>
<p><strong>2) Indirect recursion.</strong> A method invokes another method that invokes the original method.</p>
<p><strong>3) Tail-recursion.</strong> A call is tail-recursive if nothing has to be done after the call returns. I.e. when the call returns, the result is immediately returned from the calling method.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5135" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, tail recursion is a type of recursion where the recursive call is the last statement in a method, and nothing has to be done after the call returns. | This means that when the recursive call returns, the result is immediately returned from the calling method. In contrast, if additional operations are required after the recursive call, such as multiplying the result by a value, then it is not tail-recursive. Tail recursion is important because it can be more efficient than other types of recursion, as it avoids the need to create new stack frames for each recursive call.">tail recursion</a></strong> is when the recursive call is the last statement in the method.</p>
<p>The considered recursive method for calculating factorial is not tail-recursion because after the recursive call it multiplies the result by a value. But it can be written as a tail recursive function. The general idea is to use an additional argument to accumulate the factorial value. When <strong>n</strong> reaches <strong>0</strong>, the method should return the accumulated value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static long factorialTailRecursive(long n, long accum) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return accum;
    }
    return factorialTailRecursive(n - 1, n * accum);
}</code></pre>
<p>And write a special wrapper to invoke it in a more convenient way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static long factorial(long n) {
    return factorialTailRecursive(n, 1);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>4) <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5135" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, multiple recursion is a type of recursion where a method calls itself multiple times within its body, often leading to multiple layers of method calls before reaching the base case. | A classic example is calculating the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion, where each method call depends on the result of one or more previous method calls. However, this approach can be highly inefficient and is often replaced by loops or optimized techniques such as memoization.">Multiple recursion</a>.</strong> A method invokes itself recursively multiple times. The well-known example is calculating the <strong>N-th</strong> Fibonacci number using the recursion.</p>
<p>The recurrent formula:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2); Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1.</code></pre>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence starts with: <code class="language-java">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static int fib(int n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}</code></pre>
<p>This solution is very inefficient, it's just an example of <strong>multiple recursion</strong>. Try to start the method passing <strong>45</strong> as the argument. It takes too much time. If you replace the recursion with a loop it will work much faster. Another possible optimization is the technique named <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/memoized-fibonacci-numbers" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memoization</a>.</p>
