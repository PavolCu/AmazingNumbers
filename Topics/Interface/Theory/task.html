<p>In Java, an <strong>interface</strong> is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a> much like a class, however, it has distinctive features. An interface contains <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method declaration is the way to define a method, which is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. | It includes the method's name, return type, access modifier, non-access modifier (such as static), parameter list, and the method body. The method name and parameter list in parentheses form the method signature, which is used to invoke the method. The method parameter is a value that the method uses internally, and it is declared in the method signature. The method body contains a set of instructions that are executed when the method is invoked. A method declaration must follow specific rules, such as the use of keywords like void, public, and static, and it must correctly declare the method's parameter.">method declarations</a> and serves as literally an interface between a class inheriting that interface and the other classes. Unlike a <strong>class</strong>, an interface can extend multiple interfaces, and a class can implement multiple interfaces. In this topic, you will discover the importance of interfaces in Java and how they can help.</p>
<h5 id="why-interfaces">Why interfaces</h5>
<p>One of the OOP principles is abstraction: real-world objects can be represented by their abstract models. When we create these models, we focus on the essential features of the objects. For example, consider a pencil. We can use a pencil to draw. Other properties like its material, or length, might be important at times, but they do not define the idea of what a pencil is.</p>
<p>Imagine you need to design a graphics-editing program. Drawing is the basic function of the program. This tool will prompt the user to select a drawing tool before they can draw anything. They might select a pen, pencil, brush, highlighter, marker, spray, among others. Each tool in the set has specific properties â€“ the marks left by a pencil and a spray are not the same, and that matters. However, all these tools share a common critical feature: the ability to draw.</p>
<p>Next, consider the <code class="language-java">Pencil</code> class, which is an abstraction of a pencil. As mentioned earlier, at the very least, the class should have a <code class="language-java">draw</code> method that accepts a model of a curve. This method is fundamental for our program. Let's say <code class="language-java">Curve</code> is a class that represents some curve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Pencil {
    ...
    public void draw(Curve curve) {...}
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's define classes for other tools, for example, a brush:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Brush {
    ...
    public void draw(Curve curve) {...}
}</code></pre>
<p>All these tools have the <code class="language-java">draw</code> method, even though they each use the method differently. The ability to draw is something all these tools share. Let's call this feature <code class="language-java">DrawingTool</code>. Then we can say that if a class has the <code class="language-java">DrawingTool</code> feature, then it should be able to draw, which means the class should have the <code class="language-java">void draw(Curve curve) {...}</code> method.</p>
<p>Java allows declaring this feature by introducing interfaces. This is what our interface looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">interface DrawingTool {
    void draw(Curve curve);
}</code></pre>
<p>It declares the <code class="language-java">draw</code> method without implementation.</p>
<p>Now let's mark classes that are able to draw by adding <code class="language-java">implements DrawingTool</code> to the class declaration. If a class implements an interface, it has to implement all declared methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Pencil implements DrawingTool {
    ...
    public void draw(Curve curve) {...}
}

class Brush implements DrawingTool {
    ...
    public void draw(Curve curve) {...}
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, with just one glance at the class declaration, it's clear that the class can draw. In essence, interfaces are all about declaring functionality.</p>
<p>Another important advantage of introducing interfaces is that you can use them as a type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">DrawingTool pencil = new Pencil();
DrawingTool brush = new Brush();</code></pre>
<p>Now, both a pencil and a brush objects have the same type. It means that both classes can be treated similarly as a <code class="language-java">DrawingTool</code>. This is another way of supporting <strong>polymorphism</strong>, which helps to design a reusable drawing function of the graphical editor program.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">void drawCurve(DrawingTool tool, Curve curve) {
    System.out.println("Drawing a curve " + curve + " using a " + tool);
    tool.draw(curve);
}</code></pre>
<p>In many situations, it's more important to know what an object can do instead of how it does it. That's why interfaces are widely used for declaring a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> type.</p>
<h5 id="declaring-interfaces">Declaring interfaces</h5>
<p>An interface can be considered a special kind of class that can't be instantiated. To declare an interface, you should write the keyword <code class="language-java">interface</code> instead of <code class="language-java">class</code> before the name of the interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">interface Interface { }</code></pre>
<p>An interface can contain:</p>
<ul><li><p>public constants;</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an abstract method is a method that is declared in an abstract class but does not contain an implementation. | It only includes a method signature, return type, and modifiers. The abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract method. Concrete subclasses of the abstract class must provide an implementation for these abstract methods. Since an abstract class cannot be instantiated, the purpose of an abstract method is to provide a common interface for its subclasses. If a class contains an abstract method, the class must be declared abstract as well.">abstract methods</a> without an implementation (the keyword <code class="language-java">abstract</code> is not required here);</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a default method is a method that has a default implementation in an interface, which is provided using the default modifier. | They were introduced to provide backward compatibility, allowing new methods to be added to existing interfaces without affecting the classes that implement them. If a class implements multiple interfaces with default methods having the same signature, the class must define the method to resolve the diamond problem. Default methods can be accessed from the implementing class and are a type of method along with abstract and static methods.">default methods</a> with implementation (the keyword <code class="language-java">default</code> is required);</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static methods</a> with implementation (the keyword <code class="language-java">static</code> is required);</p></li><li><p>private methods with implementation.</p></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If the modifiers are not specified once the method is declared, its parameters will be <strong>public abstract</strong> by default.</p>
<p>An interface can't contain constructors, non-public abstract methods, or any fields other than <code class="language-java">public static final</code> (<strong>constants</strong>).</p>
<p> Let's declare an interface containing some methods and a constant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">interface Interface {
        
    int INT_CONSTANT = 0; // it's a constant, the same as public static final int INT_CONSTANT = 0
        
    void instanceMethod1();
        
    void instanceMethod2();
        
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Interface: static method");
    }
        
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Interface: default method");
    }

    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Interface: private method");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>later we will dive into the differences between these methods but for now, let's just keep in mind that there are different types of them.</p>
<h5 id="implementing-interfaces">Implementing interfaces</h5>
<p>A class can implement an interface using the keyword <code class="language-java">implements</code>. We must provide implementations for all abstract methods of the interface.</p>
<p>Let's implement the interface we considered earlier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Class implements Interface {

    @Override
    public void instanceMethod1() {
        System.out.println("Class: instance method1");
    }

    @Override
    public void instanceMethod2() {
        System.out.println("Class: instance method2");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can create an instance of the class and call its methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Interface instance = new Class();

instance.instanceMethod1(); // it prints "Class: instance method1"
instance.instanceMethod2(); // it prints "Class: instance method2"
instance.defaultMethod();   // it prints "Interface: default method. It can be overridden"</code></pre>
<p>Note that we use an <em>Interface</em> as the type of newly created object. In the future, you can make use of polymorphism and change the implementation of this particular Interface to some other.</p>
<p>Here the the <code class="language-java">instance</code> variable has the <code class="language-java">Interface</code> type, although it is ok to use <code class="language-java">Class</code> to denote its type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Class instance = new Class();</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>An interface is a special kind of class that cannot be instantiated. The main idea of an interface is declaring functionality. Interfaces help to abstract from specific classes and emphasize functionality. It makes software design more reusable and clean. It is a good practice to apply the so-called interface-oriented design, which means that you should rely on interfaces instead of concrete implementations. To implement an interface, the keyword <code class="language-java">implements</code> is used.</p>
